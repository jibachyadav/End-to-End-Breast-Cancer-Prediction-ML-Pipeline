# End-to-End Breast Cancer Survival Prediction ML Pipeline

 end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline for predicting breast cancer patient survival. Built with MLflow, Apache Airflow, Evidently, FastAPI, and Streamlit.

## Project Overview

This project predicts whether a breast cancer patient will **Alive** or **Dead** based on clinical features such as age, tumor size, cancer stage, and hormone receptor status.

The pipeline covers the full ML lifecycle:
- Data ingestion and validation
- Feature engineering and transformation
- Model training and evaluation
- Experiment tracking with MLflow
- REST API with FastAPI
- Interactive frontend with Streamlit
- Automated scheduling with Apache Airflow
- Model and data drift monitoring with Evidently
